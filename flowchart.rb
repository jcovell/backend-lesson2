Flowchart - Using a flowchart helps us map out the logical sequence of a possible solution in a visual way. Take a look at the various components at our disposal in a flowchart.

Start/Stop
Processing Step
Input/Output
Decision
Connector

Note that the decision (the diamond) component should only have two branches. If you have a decision condition that has 3 (or more) branches, use multiple diamonds.

Note that the arrows show the "flow" of the logic, and that we're taking great pains to specifically draw out the iteration logic. This helps us map out the step-by-step logic our program would need to solve this problem. This is called the imperative or procedural way to solve a problem. In many higher level programming languages, basic concepts (like for example, iterating over a collection) are encapsulated into a method. In Ruby, for example, we have a handy each method that allows us to iterate over an Array collection. Using each is the declarative way of solving a problem.

When working with flowcharts, we are going to be imperative in our approach, and we'll visually show how to loop manually, rather than using any declarative constructs built in to the language.

Doing this will force you understand the logic much better, and also force you to "think like a computer", which will help debug logical errors in your code. Over time, as you get better at "thinking like a computer", you can reach for the higher level declarative syntax.

As you use pseudo-code and flowcharts to help you dissect the logic of a problem, you'll be constantly trying to figure out how detailed the chart and words should be, and what can be extracted to sub-processes. This is exactly what a programmer should be thinking about when designing the solution to a problem. You won't get it right the first time.

Start at a high level, using declarative syntax.
 You're not yet outlining exactly how to validate the inputs. No specifics or imperative style pseudo-code yet. Once you have the high level steps, it's time to drill down a level into imperative pseudo-code and outline specifics.
 
 Put all examples on board and work with them.
